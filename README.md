1. After downloading the project open the terminal and go to where the project is located and type: "npm install"
   to install all packages required in the project.

2. When it has successfully compiled, open the web browser and type'localhost:4200/' to view the application. You should be able to see
   a list of Plants and the details thereof.
   
3. To add a new plant, you can click  "Add Plant" on the top left hand corner and a dialogue will appear at the bottom of the
   of the PlantList table with the necessary inputs. If all inputs are valid click "Create Plant".

 also comes with a failed reponse, I'm not sure whether its my Model when doing a post. No excuses though, this is all I was able to     provide with the said contraints.
