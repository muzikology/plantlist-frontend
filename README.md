   to install all packages required in the project.

   a list of Plants and the details thereof.
   
3. To add a new plant, you can click  "Add Plant" on the top left hand corner and a dialogue will appear at the bottom of the
   of the PlantList table with the necessary inputs. If all inputs are valid click "Create Plant".
   
   
 Concession:
 
 Because of the limitations of time the application does not filter and paginate as required. The 'create plant" function
 also comes with a failed reponse, I'm not sure whether its my Model when doing a post. No excuses though, this is all I was able to     provide with the said contraints.
